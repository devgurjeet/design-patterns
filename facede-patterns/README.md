# Facade pattern
The facade pattern (also spelled fa√ßade) is a software-design pattern commonly used with object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code. A facade can:

1) improve the readability and usability of a software library by masking interaction with more complex components behind a single (and often simplified) API
2) provide a context-specific interface to more generic functionality (complete with context-specific input validation)
3) serve as a launching point for a broader refactor of monolithic or tightly-coupled systems in favor of more loosely-coupled code
